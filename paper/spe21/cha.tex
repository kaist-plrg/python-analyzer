\section{Class hierarchy analysis}\label{sec:cha}

When developing TensorFlow DL models, user-defined classes can
inherit TensorFlow library classes. 
This allows developers to extend the methods and behaviors of TensorFlow
library classes without directly modifying the library codes. 
Figure \ref{fig:cha:tfex}(a) shows an example of TensorFlow DL model
code using an user-defined class.
In line 4, the newly defined class {\tt ResNet} inherits the TensorFlow
library class, {\tt keras.Model}.
The {\tt keras.Model} class represents a model object composed of multiple
layers, and provides trainig-related methods such as {\tt compile} or {\tt fit}.
By inheriting the {\tt keras.Model} class, the {\tt ResNet} class
can also utilize the training-related methods while defining the new model
structure.
Line 8 creates a {\tt ResNet} class instance {\tt model}.
Then the line 9 calls the {\tt fit} method which is inherited from the
{\tt keras.Model} class.
By calling the {\tt fit} method, the model instance can be autoamtically
trained without manually repeating the training steps.

To correctly transform TensorFlow DL models into the distributed models,
the transformation must recognize the user-defined classes that inherits
TensorFlwo classes.
Figure \ref{fig:cha:tfex}(b) is an example of modifying the \ref{fig:cha:tfex}(a)
into a distributed model code.
Line 9 of \ref{fig:cha:tfex}(a) is modified as line 10 to 13 of 
\ref{fig:cha:tfex}(b). The modification adds a keyword argument {\tt callbacks}
to the {\tt fit} method call. 
To correctly modify the example code, the transformation must recognize the 
the line 9 of \ref{fig:cha:tfex}(a) calls the {\tt fit} method which originates
from the {\tt keras.Model} class.


To solve this problem, we devised to pre-analyze the class inheritance
relation between TensorFlow library classes and user-defined classes. 
We utilize a \textit{class hierarchy analysis}, a type of static analysis
that identifies the inheritance relations between the classes appearing
in the code.
The class hierarchy analysis result stores the inheritance relation
which is used in later stages of the transformation.
