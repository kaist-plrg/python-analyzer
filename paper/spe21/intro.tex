\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\begin{itemize}
  \item ML is widely used in various domains these days.
  \item Distributed Training can reduce the training time.
  \item To train ML model on multi-GPUs, code transformation is required but it
    also requires human efforts. The code transformation is simple but only
    some examples describe the transformation.
  \item In this paper, we propose an automated Python code transformation that
    enables TensorFlow ML models to run on multi-GPUs (formal rule of the code
    transformation \& automated code transformation tool).
  \item Describe contributions of this paper.
\end{itemize}
