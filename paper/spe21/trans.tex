\section{Code Transformation for Distributed Training}\label{sec:trans}
\subsection{Python Abstract Syntax}\label{sec:pysyn}
Describe the simplified Python abstract syntax here. 
The abstract syntax should be sufficient to describe our code transformation. 
We can attach the full Python abstract syntax as supplementary material.

\subsection{...}
Describe how to transform TensorFlow ML models to training them on distributed
systems with the horovod framework. We can use formal rules we defined and some
code examples here. We can attach the full transformation rules as
supplementary material as well.  Please write this and some more following
subsections to describe the transformation.
