\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

We implemented the formal transformation rule for the distributed training
as a software. We designed the software to be a standalone software, so 
the ML developers can utilize the software regardless of their environment. 
The software is written in Scala; the source code and released software
is available at https://github.com/kaist-plrg/python-analyzer.
