\subsection{Horovod Distributed Training Framework}
Describe the Horovod framework.

Horovod \cite{sergeev2018horovod} is a distributed deep learning framework
that supports multiple DL frameworks. It is developed by Uber engineering in
2017 as a part of DL toolkit for Michelangelo, a ML-as-a-service platfom. 

Horovod provides high-level, easy-to-use API code for distributed training.

It is inspired by Facebook's data-parallel approach\cite{facebook2018},
which provides empricial evidence of performance advantage of distributing
large minibatch over multiple GPUs.

It is based on the data-parallel approach on distributed DL training.
In data-parallel approach, each accelerator node is equipped with independent
instances of the same DL model. The whole training dataset is then divided by
the number of the nodes, so that minibatches with the equal size is assigned
to each node. The training proceeds by parallely executing the forward
propagation and computing gradients. Then the gradients averaged all together
and used to update each model instances. This way, the data-parallel approach
improves efficiency by taking advantage of data parallelism.
