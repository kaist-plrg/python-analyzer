\subsection{TensorFlow ML Models}
Describe the structure of TensorFlow ML Models.

\subsection{Horovod Distributed Training Framework}
Describe the Horovod framework.

Horovod \cite{sergeev2018horovod} is a distributed deep learning framework
that supports multiple DL frameworks. It provides high-level, easy-to-use API
code for migrating a single-GPU DL model into multi-GPU model.
It is based on data-parallel approach, which multiple instances of
model are placed in number of nodes and parallelly trainied with
splitted sets of the training data.
