\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
We need to survey some related work and describe them here.

\subsection{Distributed DL frameworks}

Many frameworks are developed to support distributed DL training.

TensorFlow provides {\tt tf.distributed.Strategy} API to perform
distributed training across GPUs.
 
Horovod is a multi-framework library for distributed training.

(TODO: find more distributed training frameworks.)

None of these frameworks support automatic transformation from single-GPU
based training to distributed training. 

(TODO: explain that our work is different from using frameworks;
it can automatically transform)

\subsection{Code Transformation}

Code transformation is a technique which source codes are automatically
transformed into another. The techinique is primarily used in compilers,
for optimization process. 

(TODO: find more use case of code transformation)

Note that our approach is not a semantic-preserving code transformation.

(TODO: explain that our's code transformation is different from
compilers and optimization techniques)

Semantic-preserving code transformation for DL model codes should be
further investigated.
