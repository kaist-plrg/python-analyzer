\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}
Describe the structure of our code transformation tool.
We implemented the code transformation rule for distributed training in Scala,
and our work is available at https://github.com/kaist-plrg/python-analyzer.
The implementation is divided into 4 parts:
Parser, Class Hierachy Analysis,
Training API Pattern Analysis, and Transformer.
(...TODO:system architecture diagram...)

\subsection{Parser}
Describe detailed explanation of Parser.
Parser convert the code in string format into AST.
Rather than using Python AST module, we implemented parser for our tool.
We use scala packrat parser to follow the Python Language Reference
where full grammar specification is written in the form of mixture of EBNF and PEG.

\subsection{Class Hierarchy Analyzer}
Describe detailed explanation of CHA.

\subsection{Training API Pattern Analyzer}
Describe detailed explanation of TAPA.

\subsection{AST Transformer}
Describe detailed explanation of AST Transformer.
