  abstract  = {Skeletal parallelism is a model of parallelism where parallel constructs are provided to the programmer as usual patterns of parallel algorithms. High-level skeleton libraries often offer a global view of programs instead of the common Single Program Multiple Data view in parallel programming. A program is written as a sequential program but operates on parallel data structures. Most of the time, skeletons on a parallel data structure have counterparts on a sequential data structure. For example, the map function that applies a given function to all the elements of a sequential collection (e.g., a list) has a map skeleton counterpart that applies a sequential function to all the elements of a distributed collection.},

abstract={Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

abstract={A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100--0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},
