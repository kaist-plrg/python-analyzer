  abstract  = {Skeletal parallelism is a model of parallelism where parallel constructs are provided to the programmer as usual patterns of parallel algorithms. High-level skeleton libraries often offer a global view of programs instead of the common Single Program Multiple Data view in parallel programming. A program is written as a sequential program but operates on parallel data structures. Most of the time, skeletons on a parallel data structure have counterparts on a sequential data structure. For example, the map function that applies a given function to all the elements of a sequential collection (e.g., a list) has a map skeleton counterpart that applies a sequential function to all the elements of a distributed collection.},
