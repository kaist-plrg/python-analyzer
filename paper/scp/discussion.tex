\section{discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
Describe limitations of our approach (in other words, describe the best
practice in TensorFlow ML code to transform the models using our approach).
Also, we can insist that the limitations are not critical since such code
patterns do not frequently occur in real-world TensorFlow ML code.
